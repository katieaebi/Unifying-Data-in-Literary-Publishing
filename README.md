<h2>Objective</h2> 

This project built a dataset of all the [New York Times Bestsellers](https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/methodology/) lists from 2023 using Python, the [NYTâ€™s Book API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/books-product/1/overview), and the [pynytimes repository](https://pynytimes.michadenheijer.com/getting-started/citation) (Python wrapper for the API).

<h2>Files</h2>

[Indep_Study_2023_API_v_(1)](https://github.com/katieaebi/Unifying-Data-in-Literary-Publishing/blob/main/Indep_Study_2023_API_v_%20(1).ipynb)
  - notebook file with the code for how to make the dataset
<b>Other files</b>
  - all other files in this repository are CSVs of the data collected, separated by genre category (although they are uploaded as .txt files, trust they are comma delimited and can be loaded in as such).
